### **Satellite Image Segmentation**
- Worked on segmenting satellite imagery to identify regions of ice, water, and clouds.

### **Denoising and Image Enhancement** (2020–Present)
- Created a custom implementation of **Non-Local Means** and trained a dual-context neural network for denoising.
- Optimized segmentation models for deployment on **iOS** and **Android** platforms.

### **Pose Estimation Optimization**
- Integrated **OpticalFlow** with Pose Estimation models to enhance performance on video data.
- Built cross-platform bindings with **Objective-C** and **JNI** for seamless mobile integration.

### **Generative Models and Style Transfer**
- Explored **StyleGAN** inversion for stylization workflows and trained **Image2Image** models for photo transformations.
- Deployed models using **Triton** and custom cloud pipelines.

### **Interactive Image Segmentation**
- Implemented **HRNet**-based interactive segmentation of arbitrary objects with user behavior simulation and mobile deployment.

### **Automated Image Adjustment**
- Built models for predicting image parameters like brightness, contrast, saturation, and LUTs for automated image enhancements.

### **Diffusion Models and Generative Techniques**
- Developed pipelines for **DreamBooth-like** personalized generation and **TryOn** clothing simulations.
- Trained custom **controlnets** to enhance identity preservation and optimized **SDXL** for inpainting tasks.
- Implemented ["Diffusion Training from Scratch on a Micro-Budget"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15811) approach from scratch.

### **Leadership and Collaboration**
- Interviewed candidates for technical roles and led teams in delivering diffusion transformer and image enhancement projects.
